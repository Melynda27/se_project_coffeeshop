# SE_PROJECT_COFFEESHOP

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. Why design a website for Triple Peaks Coffee Shop? Mainly to showcase what it's like in the library's study zone and all the great things customers can enjoy. Plus, this website design highlights amazing recipes that customers can watch without needing to search. If they want to book a table, they can easily do so right on Triple Peaks Coffee Shop's website! Need a sneak peek at the menu? Thatâ€™s right at your fingertips as well! If you wish to learn more while enjoying some of their amazing food or coffee, you can easily read all about them on their website!

## Project features

## Plan on improving the project

Something that would make this really cool is adding a cute review section! That way, Triple Peaks Coffee Shop can share their customers' feedback with people who are interested in trying their food or drinks. Or, they could have a section where customers can vote on a "Flavor of the Week" for coffee. They could make it very interactive and maybe show percentages of how many individuals agree/disagree. It could be a really fun way to interact with customers and include their favorites, which could attract more customers and create hype in the long run.
